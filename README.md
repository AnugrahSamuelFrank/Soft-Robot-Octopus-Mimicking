# Soft-Robot-Octopus-Mimicking
This octopus-inspired robot uses soft, flexible limbs with multiple degrees of freedom for pick-and-place tasks and navigation. Operated through pneumatics, it is designed in SolidWorks and analyzed in ANSYS. Biomimetic motion and sensor-based control allow it to adapt to various object shapes and textures in complex environments.
